#summary Once again into fileids and filenames

= Introduction =

Hopefully solving the fileid/filename problem for the last time

= Details =

SYNCHRONIZATION:

A: request root from B
B: send root fileid to B
A: compare current stored root for B with sent root
   IF match THEN done
   ELSE
A: request children of root
B: send back (fileid,filename) pairs of children.  filename is full path.
A: compare each each sent fileid to stored fileids

/* ALTERNATE SOLUTION */
 FOR EACH sent_filename
   IF filename match THEN
     compare the fileids, see if the content has changed
     mark filename as seen
     IF fileid matches THEN
       same file
     ELSE
       update_file
       request_children
     END IF
   ELSE
     add_file
     request_children
   END IF  
 NEXT

 FOR EACH filename
   IF NOT seen
     DELETE filename
   END IF
 NEXT

Store.cc:
* get_file_by_filename
* get_children_by_filename
* remove_file_by_filename (recursive!)

 


/* alternate wrong original solution!!! */
 FOR EACH sent_fileid
   IF fileid match THEN
     compare the filename with the filenames associated with that fileid
     IF filename match THEN
       same file!  
       mark fileid(filename) as seen.
     ELSE
       rename/add.
       add file.
       doesn't mark fileid(filename). // will delete at cleanup
     END IF
   ELSE 
     IF filename match THEN
       file changed.  
       add file.
     ELSE
       new file!  
       add file.
     END IF
     request children of this file, if any, by sending the filename.
   END IF
 NEXT

 FOR EACH filename IN fileid.listfilenames
    IF not seen filename THEN
      delete filename
    END IF
